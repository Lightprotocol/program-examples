# Compressed Accounts Program Examples

Examples for building with ZK compression by Light Protocol.

## Examples

### Counter Program

The counter program implements a compressed account lifecycle (create, increment, decrement, reset, close):

- **[counter/anchor](./counter/anchor/)** - Anchor program with Rust and TypeScript tests
- **[counter/native](./counter/native/)** - Native Solana program with light-sdk and Rust tests.
- **[counter/pinocchio](./counter/pinocchio/)** - Pinocchio program with light-sdk-pinocchio and Rust tests.

### Create and Update Program

- **[create-and-update](./create-and-update/)** - Create a new compressed account and update an existing compressed account with a single validity proof in one instruction.

### Solana vs compressed accounts comparison Program

- **[account-comparison](./account-comparison/)** - Compare compressed vs regular Solana accounts.

## Light Protocol Libraries Used

### Rust Crates

- `light-sdk` - Core SDK for compressed accounts in native and anchor programs
- `light-sdk-pinocchio` Core SDK for compressed accounts in pinocchio programs
- `light-hasher` - Hashing utilities for ZK compression
- `light-client` - RPC client and indexer for interacting with compressed accounts
- `light-program-test` - Testing utilities for compressed programs.

### TypeScript/JavaScript Packages

- `@lightprotocol/stateless.js` - Client library for interacting with compressed accounts
- `@lightprotocol/zk-compression-cli` - Command-line tools for ZK compression development

## Prerequisites

Required versions:

- **Rust**: 1.86.0 or later
- **Solana CLI**: 2.2.15
- **Anchor CLI**: 0.31.1
- **Zk compression CLI**: 0.27.0 or later
- **Node.js**: 23.5.0 or later

Install the Light CLI:

```bash
$ npm -g i @lightprotocol/zk-compression-cli
```

Install Solana CLI:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v2.2.15/install)"
```

Install Anchor CLI:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --force
avm install latest
avm use latest
```

## Getting Started with your own Program

1. install the light cli

```bash
$ npm -g i @lightprotocol/zk-compression-cli
```

2. instantiate a template Solana program with compressed accounts

```bash
$ light init <project-name>
```
